= Introduction

Zhetapi is a `C++17` ML and numerical analysis API that was built in the hopes of
making mathematical computation and algorithmic research more convenient to
users. In the name of convenience and beginner-friendliness, the API comes with a
scripting language, Zhetapi-lang.

= Features

== Evaluation of Complex Expressions

The library can evaluate complex expressions, which have operands of various
types, such as integers, rational numbers, complex numbers, vectors and
matrices.

Through the RTTI mechanism of C++, the framework of the library allows the
evaluation to be sensitive to certain types of operands and their corresponding
operations. For example, multiplication of two integers yields an integer, the
division of two rational numbers stays rational, and the product of a matrix,
whose components are integers, with a rational scalar, yields a matrix with
rational components.

```
# Prints 12/5, not 2.4
println(3 * 4/5)

f(x) = x^2 - x/2

# Prints 153/2
println(f(9))
```

== User Defined Functions

Users can create mathematical functions (distinct from algorithms),
which can then be used as any other C++ functor object.

```cpp
Function f = "f(x) = x^2";

// Prints "10"
cout << f(10) << endl;

// Prints "9/16"
cout << f(Rational <int> {3, 4}) << endl;

// Prints "25.0"
cout << f(5.0) << endl;
```

In Zhetapi-lang, the code above translates to the following:

```
f(x) = x^2

println(f(10))
println(f(3/4))
println(f(5.0))
```

== Calculus

An object of class `Function` can be differentiated in terms of any of its
variables, to get its gradients and such. This process is symbolic, which has
the advantage that one has a closed form for the derivative, but the
disadvantage that it could be very complicated. Automatic differentiation is still
being worked on.

```cpp
Function f = "f(x) = x^2";

// Compute df/dx
Function df = f.derivative();

// Prints "f(x) = x^2"
cout << f << endl;

// Prints "df/dx(x) = 2x"
cout << df << endl;

// Prints "df/dx(2) = 4" twice
cout << "df/dx(2) = " << f.differentiate(2) << endl;
cout << "df/dx(2) = " << df(2) << endl;
```

The equivalent of this in Zhetapi-lang is the following:

```
f(x) = x^2

# or df = df/dx
df = f.derivative()

println(f)
println(df)

# Currently no .derivative(...) overload
# println("df/dx(2) = ", f.derivative(2))
println("df/dx(2) = ", df(2))
```

== Machine Learning

Along with providing many mathematical utilities, Zhetapi also provides
machine learning capabilities. Currently, Zhetapi provides a `DNN`
class that user can use to train deep neural networks on data sets.

=== Construction of Models

Deep neural networks are constructed in a very intuitive manner:

```cpp
using namespace zhetapi;

// 10 neurons inputs, rest of the layers is intuitive
model = ml::DNN <double> (10, {
	ml::Layer <double> (2, new zhetapi::ml::Linear <double> ()),
	ml::Layer <double> (5, new zhetapi::ml::Sigmoid <double> ()),
	ml::Layer <double> (5, new zhetapi::ml::ReLU <double> ()),
	ml::Layer <double> (2, new zhetapi::ml::ReLU <double> ())
});
```

The first argument is the number of input features, and the second is a list
of layers. Each layer must specify the number of output neurons and the activation
(see `engine/std/activations.hpp` for the default set of activations). Users can
additionally specify an initializer like Xavier (see `engine/std/initializers.hpp`
for the defaults) and the dropout rate.

=== Saving and loading models

Users can save and load DNNs with the simple `save` and `load` methods.

```cpp
// Save the model to model-save.out
old.save("model-save.out");

// ....

// Load the old model from model-save.out
model.load("model-save.out");
```

The save format is pure binary, and adheres to a specific order and format.

=== Using the Models

With C++ operator overloading, using the DNN is as simple as calling it
as a functor:

```cpp
cout << model({3, 5}) << endl;
cout << model({4, 5}) << endl;
```

=== Training the Models

The DNN class itself does not have any methods for fitting; it can only return
gradients and Jacobians. Instead, use function like `fit`:

```cpp
using namespace zhetapi;

ml::Erf <double> *erf = new ml::MSE <double> ();
ml::Optimizer <double> *opt = new ml::Adam <double> ();

Vector <double> in;
Vector <double> out;

// Initialize in and out...

fit(model, in, out, erf, opt);

// DataSet is an alias for std::vector <Vector <T>>
DataSet <double> ins;
DataSet <double> outs;

// Initialize ins and outs...

fit(model, ins, outs, erf, opt);

// Last parameter specifies the desired number of threads
multithreaded_fit(model, ins, outs, erf, opt, 8);

// Find other methods at engine/training.hpp...
```

All the training functions are present in `engine/training.hpp`, and the
default cost functions and optimizers can be found in `engine/std/erfs.hpp`
and `engine/std/optimizers.hpp`.

For a more comprehensive and practical example, see the `samples/mnist`
directory, in which we train a deep neural network to recognize hand written
digits from the MNIST data set.

== Linear Algebra

Linear algebra can be done with the `Vector` and `Matrix` classes. These
classes entail intuitive usage through a variety of applications.

Zhetapi provides standard linear algebra routines like Gram Shmit, QR
and LQ factorization and others (see `engine/std/linalg.hpp`):

```cpp
using namespace zhetapi;

/* This is how to initialize a matrix from construction
 *
 * This allows one to perform many grid-based
 * algorithms (like dynamic programming) easily.
 *
 * For a relatively extreme example, see the
 * implementation of the levenshtein algorithm
 * in `source/lang/error_handling.cpp`
 */
Matrix <double> mat(5, 5,
	[](size_t i, size_t j) -> double {
		return (i == j) ? i + 1 : 0;
	}
);

// Easy to understand names for properties
cout << is_diag(mat) << endl;
cout << is_identity(mat) << endl;

Vector <double> eigens = qr_algorithm(mat);

// Will print the diagonal elements of mat
cout << "eigens = " << eigens << endl;

// Flatten mat as a matrix
Vector <double> fl = flatten(mat);
```

= Scripting Language

Zhetapi-lang is a scripting language that on the surface appears to be very
similar to Python. However, there is much more focus on the mathematical and
notational aspects.

Current features include declaring variables (these include constant and
mathematical functions), looping (with `while` and `for`), importing libraries,
and defining and using algorithms.

A sample script is presented below:

```
# Single-line comments are alike to Python and Bash

# This is how you would import a library
import math

# This is how to define a function
f(x) = x^3 + x * sin(x)

if (f(10) >= 0)
	println("f(10) = ", f(10))
else
	println("f(10) is less than 0")

i = 0
while (i++ < 10)
	println("[i = ", i, "] f(i) = ", f(i))

# Note the distinction between functions and algorithms
# An algorithm is like the Python equivalent of a function,
# and functions are like Python lambdas
alg myalg()
{
	x = 42
	println("x = ", x)
}

# Prints "x = 42"
myalg()
```

This scripting language is designed to make it easier to test and implement
algorithms in ML and numerical analysis. Get started with the interpreter with
`zhetapi -h`:

```
Usage: zhetapi [options] file...
Options:
 -c		Compiles the files into a single library.
 -d		Displays exported symbols in the libraries specified.
 -h		Display the guide for the interpreter.
 -o <file>	Place the compiled library into <file>.
 -L <directory>	Add <directory> to the interpreter's library search path
```

|===


= Building and Usage

Most of the features of Zhetapi depend only on `C++17` and the Boost library
(preferable version 1.65). CMake is used to compile the targets.

We recommend that you use the `g++-8` compiler, as it is the only one tested
so far.

*macOS (High Sierra and later)*

```
$ brew install gcc@8 boost cmake
```

*Ubuntu (18.04 and later)*

```
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8 libboost-dev cmake
```

Additional dependencies for image processing are `libpng`, `OpenGL` and `GLFW3`.
These are specifically used only for loading and displaying images.

To install the interpreter for Zhetapi-lang, run `./run.py install -j[THREADS=8]`
in the home directory of this repository. This is also compile the API libraries
(`libzhp.so`, `libzhpcuda.so` and `libzhp.a`) and the default Zhetapi-lang
libraries (`math` and `io` for now).

To use the C++ API in your own programs, include the `engine` directory (which
includes all the headers) and link your program with the shared/static libraries.

This project is being developed on Unix environments (MacOS and Linux) and has
only been tested for them. It is a work in progress.

= What Next?

== Simplification of Functions

Currently, objects of the `Function` class lack the complete ability to simplify
their representations. Some of this functionality does already exist, such as
the fact that adding/subtracting by 0 and multiplying/dividing by 1 are trivial
actions.

As an example, it is not yet possible to have the object recognize that
`3xy + 5yx` is the same as `8xy`. This feature would also help reduce the
complexity of derivatives of these objects.

== Integration and Differentiation

Symbolic differentiation is a current feature. However, integration is not. This
feature will be implemented as soon as the current framework has been properly
placed. The addition of other kinds of differentiation and integration, such as
automatic differentiation, and different types of numerical integration
(quadrature, etc.), is also something to look forward to.

== Exact Forms of Numbers

One recognizes, simply by looking at the first few digits, that the number
`3.141592` is most nearly pi, and that the number `2.7182817` is most nearly
Euler's number. The hope is that at some point, the library will be able to
reach similar conclusions, through the help of integer relations algorithms such

== More Extensive Support for Machine Learning

Deep neural networks are already present in the Zhetapi library. The next steps
would be implementing convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and other structures
used in supervised learning. In addition, structures and algorithms used in unsupervised
learning and other branches of AI shall also be added.
