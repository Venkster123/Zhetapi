# Introduction
Zhetapi is a `C++17` computation library that was built in the hopes of
making mathematical computation and algorithmic research more convenient to the
users.

This project is being developed on Unix environments and has only been tested
for them. It is a work in progress.

# Usage and Installation

All applications headers use the `g++-8` compiler and Boost 1.65.1 or later
(for Spirit, Phoenix and Fusion). Additionally, CMake is used to build the applications.

*macOS (High Sierra and later)*

```
$ brew install gcc@8 boost cmake
```

*Ubuntu (18.04 and later)*

```
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8 libboost-dev cmake
```

## Zhetapi CLI

The Zhetapi CLI is a command-line calculator application, similar to GNU Octave,
with additional abilities to store variables and define functions. The user can
also enter special commands, by using a `#` before specifying the command name
(ie. the `#list` command lists all available commands).

To install the CLI (Unix systems only), change to the `zhetapi` directory and
execute `./run install`. The command will build the CLI, along with other applications
and make the `zhetapi` command globally available.

To exit the CLI, simply enter `#q` or `#quit` from the CLI or terminate the
program with `Ctrl-C`.

## Zhetapi-lang

Along with API and CLI application, Zhetapi provides a scripting language
(currently in the process of development). Current features include declaring
values (constants and functions), `while` loops and `if`-`elif`-`else` branching,
as well as a very basic form of importing libraries. A sample script is presented
below:

```
# Single-line comments are alike to Python and Bash

# Note the simplicity in defining mathematical functions
f(x) = x^3 + x * sin(x)

if (f(10) >= 0)
	println("f(10) = ", f(10))
else
	println("f(10) is less than 0")

i = 0
while (i++ < 10)
	println("[i = ", i, "] f(i) = ", f(i))
```

Zhetapi-lang is a scripting language intended to make the
development of numerical and machine learning algorithms
very simple.

To compile the interpreter, run the `./run install` command in the
repository's home, and add its `bin` folder to your shell's `$PATH`
variable. From there, use `czhp -h` to get started with the interpreter.

# Features

## Evaluation of Complex Expressions

The library can evaluate complex expressions, which have operands of various
types, such as integers, rational numbers, complex numbers, vectors and
matrices.

Through the RTTI mechanism of C++, the framework of the library allows the
evaluation to be sensitive to certain types of operands and their corresponding
operations. For example, multiplication of two integers yields an integer, the
division of two rational numbers stays rational, and the product of a matrix,
whose components are integers, with a rational scalar, yields a matrix with
rational components.

The `expression.h` header contains `expr()` and `exprf()`, which return
the value of the passed expression as a string. The difference in these two lies
in the fact that `exprf()` takes in a formatted string, while `expr()`
takes a string object.

```cpp
// Not formatted, prints "1.0"
cout << expr("1 + 2!/2.0") << endl;

// Formatted, also prints "1.0"
cout << exprf("%d + %d!/2.0", 1, 2) << endl;
```

## Usage and Declaration of Variables

The library provides constructs that allow the user to store variables and
retrieve them in the scope of the `Barn` class. Users can then refer to these
variables, and their values can be retrieved or changed.

```cpp
Variable <double> x {"x", 46};

Barn <double, int> brn;

brn.add(x);

// Prints "[x] - 46"
cout << brn.get("x") << endl;

// Generates an exception
cout << brn.get("y") << endl;
```

## User Defined Functions

Users can create mathematical functions, which can then be used as any other C++
functor object.

```cpp
Function <double, int> f = "f(x) = x^2";

// Prints "10"
cout << f(10) << endl;

// Prints "9/16"
cout << f(Rational <int> {3, 4}) << endl;

// Prints "25.0"
cout << f(5.0) << endl;
```

## Calculus

An object of class `Function` can be differentiated in terms of any of its
variables, to get its gradients and such. This process is symbolic, which has
the advantage that one has a closed form for the derivative, but the
disadvantage that it could be very complicated.

```cpp
Function <double, int> f = "f(x) = x^2";

// Compute df/dx
Function <double, int> df = f.derivative();

// Prints "f(x) = x^2"
cout << f << endl;

// Prints "df/dx(x) = 2x"
cout << df << endl;

// Prints "df/dx(2) = 4" twice
cout << "df/dx(2) = " << f.differentiate(2) << endl;
cout << "df/dx(2) = " << df(2) << endl;
```

## Machine Learning

Along with providing many mathematical utilities, Zhetapi also provides
machine learning capabilities. Currently, Zhetapi provides a `NeuralNetwork`
class that user can use to train deep neural networks on data sets.

### Construction of Models
Deep neural networks can be initialized in three ways. The first and canonical
method is as follows:

```cpp
model = zhetapi::NeuralNetwork <double> ({
	{2, new zhetapi::ml::Linear <double> ()},
	{5, new zhetapi::ml::Sigmoid <double> ()},
	{5, new zhetapi::ml::ReLU <double> ()},
	{2, new zhetapi::ml::ReLU <double> ()}
}, []() {return rand()/(double) RAND_MAX;});
```

Users can customize the model by specifying the number of neurons in each
layer and the activation to use.

Users can also load models from save files:

```cpp
model.load("model-save.out");
```

The file `model-save.out` must adhere to a specific binary format, that is
automated with the `NeuralNetwork::save` method:

```cpp
old.save("model-save.out");
```

Finally, users can load the structure of a model using a JSON file:

```cpp
model.load_json("model.json");
```

The file `model.json` must be in a structure similar to the following:

```json
{
    "Layers" : [
			{
            "Neurons": 784,
            "Activation": {
		    "Name": "Linear",
		    "Arguments": [1]
	    }
        },

        {
            "Neurons": 30,
            "Activation": {
		    "Name": "Sigmoid",
		    "Arguments": []
	    }
        },

        {
            "Neurons": 10,
            "Activation": {
		    "Name": "Softmax",
		    "Arguments": []
	    }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Using the Models

With C++ operator overloading, using the
neural network is as easy as calling it as a function:

```cpp
// Initialize weights randomly
model.randomize();

cout << model({3, 5}) << endl;
cout << model({4, 5}) << endl;
```

### Training the Models

Training is also very simple:

```cpp
// Create the cost function
zhetapi::ml::Erf <double> *opt = new zhetapi::ml::MeanSquaredError <double> ();

model.set_cost(opt);

/* Run a training session of 10 epochs
 * with ins as the set of inputs and outs
 * as the set of ouputs, with batches of
 * size 250 and an initial learning rate of 0.1.
 *
 * Runs with 8 threads, as specified in the template
 * parameter.
 */
model.train_epochs <8> (ins, outs, 10, 250, 0.1);
```

Note that the `NeuralNetwork::train_epochs` method takes a template parameter.
This parameter indicates how many threads are to be used to train the model.

Support for NVIDIA GPUs is granted with the Zhetapi library's `cuda` branch.
Training on these GPUs is as simple as follows:

```cpp
// The critique function: determines when two outputs are equivalent
// Note that it must be defined on the device, using the __device__ attribute
auto crit = [] __device__ (zhetapi::Vector <double> actual,
	zhetapi::Vector <double> expected) {
		return actual == expected;
};

model.cuda_epochs(ins, outs, 10, 250, 0.1, crit);
```

For a more comprehensive and practical example, see the `samples/mnist`
directory, in which we train a deep neural network to recognize hand written
digits from the MNIST data set.

## Code Generation and Dynamically Optimizing Functions

In addition to being able to define and use functions, the user can generate
source code for the function using the `Function::generate_general` method.
The user should note that the code generated still uses the Zhetapi API.

```cpp
Function <double, int> f = "f(x) = x^2 + x * ln(x)";

// Generates the source code for
// f in the file __gen_f.cpp
f.generate_general();
```

For the example function above, the source code generated would look like the
following:

```cpp
#include <token.hpp>
#include <function.hpp>

extern "C" {
	zhetapi::Barn <double, int> __gen_f_barn;

	zhetapi::token *__gen_f(zhetapi::token *in1)
	{
		zhetapi::token *c1 = new zhetapi::operand <int> (2);
		zhetapi::token *inter1 = __gen_f_barn.compute("^", {in1, c1});
		zhetapi::token *inter2 = __gen_f_barn.compute("ln", {in1});
		zhetapi::token *inter3 = __gen_f_barn.compute("*", {in1, inter2});
		zhetapi::token *inter4 = __gen_f_barn.compute("+", {inter1, inter3});
		return inter4;
	}
}
```

The user can also dynamically compile these generated files using the
`Function::compile_general` method:

```cpp
// Initialize the Function object
Function <double, int> fx = "f(x) = x^2 + x * ln(x)";

// Prints "123.026"
cout << fx(10)->str() << endl;

// Cast the generated function
typedef token *(*ftr)(token *);

ftr gfx = (ftr) fx.compile_general();

// Allocate the operands
token *opd = new operand <int> (10);

// Also prints "123.026"
cout << gfx(opd)->str() << endl;

// Free resources
delete opd;
```

The method returns a pointer to the compiled and linked function, which the user
should then cast to use. Note that because of the usage of the Zhetapi API in
the generated source code, the user must pass pointers to tokens as operands of
the casted function. It is guaranteed, however, that the pointers passed to the
generated functions are not modified in any way. Thus, the user is responsible
for freeing the memory allocated for performed the computations.

The advantage of using the generated function is that it carries less overhead
in computations when compared to objects of the `Function` class.

## Linear Algebra

The library also provides ways in which the user can do linear algebra. The
classes `Vector` and `Matrix` come with a variety of methods on their own, which
include performing computation as well as manipulation of their representations.

In addition to these classes, the library provides standard algorithms such as Gram
Schmidt and LU Factorization (see below).

# What Next?

## Simplification of Functions

Currently, objects of the `Function` class lack the complete ability to simplify
their representations. Some of this functionality does already exist, such as
the fact that adding/subtracting by 0 and multiplying/dividing by 1 are trivial
actions.

As an example that is not yet featured, it is not yet possible to have the
object recognize that `3xy + 5yx` is the same as `8xy`. This feature would also
help reduce the complexity of derivatives of these objects.

## Integration and Differentiation

Symbolic differentiation is a current feature. However, integration is not. This
feature will be implemented as soon as the current framework has been properly
placed. The addition of other kinds of differentiation and integration, such as
automatic differentiation, and different types of numerical integration
(quadrature, etc.), is also something to look forward to.

## Exact Forms of Numbers

One recognizes, simply by looking at the first few digits, that the number
`3.141592` is most nearly pi, and that the number `2.7182817` is most nearly
Euler's number. The hope is that at some point, the library will be able to
reach similar conclusions, through the help of integer relations algorithms such
as PSLQ.

## More Algorithms in Linear Algebra

Although there are a few standard linear algebra algorithms, the hope is that
more will be added. These include QR factorization, SVD, diagonalization, etc.

## More Extensive Support for Machine Learning

Deep neural networks are already present in the Zhetapi library. The next steps
would be implementing convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and other structures
used in supervised learning. In addition, structures and algorithms used in unsupervised
learning and other branches of AI shall also be added.

## Primitive Code Generation

The library already can generate, compile and link `Function`
objects in runtime. However, as mentioned, the source generated uses the Zhetapi
API. This is disadvantageous in that it takes much longer to compile than native
programs, and the user also has the added responsibility of managing the
resources for the computation of the generated function.

The next step is to generate source code natively, using only native types that
the user specifies. The only library functions that should be used are those in
any of the headers in the `inc/std` directory (for example, if the function uses
the binomial coefficient, then the source would include the
`std_combinatorial.hpp` header).

## Python Bindings

Python is a very well supported scripting language, with many existing libraries
and a large community. Adding bindings for certain library features, especially
the machine learning facilities, would make it much easier to use and test them.

## Improve Semantics

The library aims to allow the user to perform mathematical tasks with
ease. Thus, the notational convenience of library features is important and is a
task that remains to be seen through.
